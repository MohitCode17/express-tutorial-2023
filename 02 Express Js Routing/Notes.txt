ðŸ¤” Express Js - Routing

Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

ðŸ¤” Route definition takes the following structure:

- app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)

  Where:
    - app is an instance of express
    - METHOD is an HTTP request method(get, post, put, delete)
    - PATH is the route at which the request will run.
    - HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.


ðŸ¤” Express.Router

Defining routes like in example of (index.js) is very tedious to maintain. To separate the routes from our main index.js file, 
we will use Express.Router

ðŸ‘‰Create a new file called router.js and type the following in it.

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res)=>{
  res.send('GET route on things.');
});

module.exports = router;

ðŸ‘‰Now to use this router in our index.js, type in the following before the app.listen function call.

const express = require('Express');
const app = express();
const router = require('./router');
app.use(router);
app.listen(3000);

ðŸ‘‰ What is HTTP?

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.
HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

ðŸ‘‰ HTTP Methods:

GET: GET is used to request data from a specified resource.
	
POST: POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
	
PUT: PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

DELETE: The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
