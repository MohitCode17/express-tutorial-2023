ðŸ¤” Serving Static Files in Express

Static files are files that don't change when your application is running.

ðŸ‘‰ To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the "express.static" built-in middleware function in Express.

express.static(root, [options])

The root argument specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets.

app.use(express.static('public'))

Now, you can load the files that are in the public directory.

ðŸ‘‰ To use multiple static assets directories, call the express.static middleware function multiple times.

app.use(express.static('public'))
app.use(express.static('files'))


ðŸ‘‰ To create a virtual path prefix (where the path does not actually exist in the file system) for files that are served by the express.static function, 

specify a mount path for the static directory, as shown below:

app.use('/static', express.static('public'))


However, the path that you provide to the express.static function is relative to the directory from where you launch your node process. 
If you run the express app from another directory, itâ€™s safer to use the absolute path of the directory that you want to serve:

const path = require('path')
app.use('/static', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')))
